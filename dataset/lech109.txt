9.1 Werner’
Werner’ss
Theory of
Coordination
Compounds

Coordination Compounds are the backbone of modern inorganic
and bio–inorganic chemistry and chemical industry.

In the previous Unit we learnt that the transition metals
form a large number of complex compounds in which
the metal atoms are bound to a number of anions or
neutral molecules by sharing of electrons. In modern
terminology such compounds are called coordination
compounds. The chemistry of coordination compounds
is an important and challenging area of modern
inorganic chemistry. New concepts of chemical bonding
and molecular structure have provided insights into
the functioning of these compounds as vital components
of biological systems. Chlorophyll, haemoglobin and
vitamin B12 are coordination compounds of magnesium,
iron and cobalt respectively. Variety of metallurgical
processes, industrial catalysts and analytical reagents
involve the use of coordination compounds.
Coordination compounds also find many applications
in electroplating, textile dyeing and medicinal chemistry.

Alfred Werner (1866-1919), a Swiss chemist was the first to formulate
his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He prepared
and characterised a large number of coordination compounds and
studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental
techniques. Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and
a secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as
CrCl3, CoCl2 or PdCl2 have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively.
In a series of compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia, it was
found that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on
adding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in
solution.

These observations, together with the results of conductivity
measurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all,
either chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to
the cobalt ion during the reaction and (ii) the compounds are formulated
as shown in Table 9.1, where the atoms within the square brackets
form a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction
conditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the
number of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these
examples the secondary valences are six.

Note that the last two compounds in Table 9.1 have identical empirical
formula, CoCl3.4NH3, but distinct properties. Such compounds are
termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of
coordination compounds. The main postulates are:
1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages
(valences)-primary and secondary.
2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by
negative ions.
3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by
neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to
the coordination number and is fixed for a metal.
4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have
characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different
coordination numbers.
In modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called
coordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are
coordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square
bracket are called counter ions.
He further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar
geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of
transition metals. Thus, [Co(NH3)6]3+, [CoCl(NH3)5]2+ and [CoCl2(NH3)4]+
2–
are octahedral entities, while [Ni(CO)4] and [PtCl4] are tetrahedral and
square planar, respectively.

Difference between a double salt and a complex

Both double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination
of two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio. However, they
differ in the fact that double salts such as carnallite, KCl.MgCl2.6H2O,
Mohr’s salt, FeSO4.(NH4)2SO4.6H2O, potash alum, KAl(SO4)2.12H2O, etc.
dissociate into simple ions completely when dissolved in water. However,
4–
complex ions such as [Fe(CN)6] of K4 [Fe(CN)6] do not dissociate into
2+
–
Fe and CN ions.

Werner

was born on December 12, 1866, in Mülhouse,
a small community in the French province of Alsace.
His study of chemistry began in Karlsruhe (Germany)
and continued in Zurich (Switzerland), where in his
doctoral thesis in 1890, he explained the difference in
properties of certain nitrogen containing organic
(1866-1919)
substances on the basis of isomerism. He extended vant
Hoff’s theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified
it for nitrogen. Wer ner showed optical and electrical differences between
complex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was
the first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds.
He, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische
Hochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist.
His accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination
compounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about
how atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of
only three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent
gathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas. Werner
became the first Swiss chemist to win the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work
on the linkage of atoms and the coordination theory.

9.2 Definitions of
Some
Important
Terms
Pertaining to
Coordination
Compounds

( a ) Coordination entity

A coordination entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded
to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example, [CoCl3(NH3)3]
is a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by
three ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples
4–
3+
are [Ni(CO)4], [PtCl2(NH3)2], [Fe(CN)6] , [Co(NH3)6] .
( b ) Central

atom/ion

In a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number
of ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement
around it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the
central atom/ion in the coordination entities: [NiCl 2(H 2O)4],
[CoCl(NH3)5]2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3– are Ni2+, Co3+ and Fe3+, respectively.
These central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids.
( c ) Ligands

The ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the
coordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions
–
such as Cl , small molecules such as H2O or NH3, larger molecules
such as H2NCH2CH2NH2 or N(CH2CH2NH2)3 or even macromolecules,
such as proteins.
When a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor
–
atom, as with Cl , H2O or NH3, the ligand is said to be unidentate.
When a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in
2–
H2NCH2CH2NH2 (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C2O4 (oxalate), the
ligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are
present in a single ligand as in N(CH2CH2NH2)3, the ligand is said
4–
to be polydentate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA ) is
an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two
nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.
When a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor
atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a
chelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the
denticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes
tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate
ligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of
the two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate
–
ligand. Examples of such ligands are the NO2 and
–
–
SCN ions. NO2 ion can coordinate either through
nitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal
atom/ion.
–
Similarly, SCN ion can coordinate through the
sulphur or nitrogen atom.
( d ) Coordination

number

The coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be
defined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is
2–
directly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, [PtCl6] and
2+
[Ni(NH3)4] , the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4
3–
respectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, [Fe(C2O4)3] and
3+
[Co(en)3] , the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because
2–
C2O4 and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.
247

2022-23

Coordination Compounds

It is important to note here that coordination number of the central
atom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by
the ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the
ligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.
(e) Coordination sphere

The central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in
square bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination
sphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and
are called counter ions. For example, in the complex K4[Fe(CN)6],
4–
+
the coordination sphere is [Fe(CN)6] and the counter ion is K .
(f)

Coordination polyhedron

The spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly
attached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination
polyhedron about the central atom. The most common
coordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and
3+
tetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH3)6] is octahedral, [Ni(CO)4] is
2–
tetrahedral and [PtCl4] is square planar. Fig. 9.1 shows the
shapes of different coordination polyhedra.

Fig. 9.1: Shapes of different coordination polyhedra. M represents
the central atom/ion and L, a unidentate ligand.
(g) Oxidation number of central atom

The oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined
as the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along
with the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The
oxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis
following the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation
3–
number of copper in [Cu(CN)4] is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).
(h) Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes

Complexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor
3+
groups, e.g., [Co(NH3)6] , are known as homoleptic. Complexes in
which a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups,
+
e.g., [Co(NH3)4Cl2] , are known as heteroleptic.

9.3 Nomenclature
of
Coordination
Compounds

Nomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the
need to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and
writing systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The
formulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the
recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC).

9.3.1 Formulas of
Mononuclear
Coordination
Entities

Note: The 2004 IUPAC
draft recommends that
ligands will be sorted
alphabetically,

9.3.2 Naming of
Mononuclear
Coordination
Compounds

Note: The 2004 IUPAC
draft recommends that
anionic ligands will end
with–ido so that chloro
would become chlorido,
etc.

The formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic
information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and
convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single
central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas:
(i) The central atom is listed first.
(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of
a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.
(iii) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of
abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to
determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.
(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or
not, is enclosed in square brackets. When ligands are polyatomic,
their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations
are also enclosed in parentheses.
(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal
within a coordination sphere.
(vi) When the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written
without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the
square brackets as a right superscript with the number before the
3–
3+
sign. For example, [Co(CN)6] , [Cr(H2O)6] , etc.
(vii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s).
The names of coordination compounds are derived by following the
principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the
central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes
to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers.
The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds:
(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged
coordination entities.
(ii) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the
central atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).
(iii) Names of the anionic ligands end in –o, those of neutral and cationic
ligands are the same except aqua for H2O, ammine for NH3, carbonyl
for CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination
entity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ).
(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the
individual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of
the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris,
tetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in
parentheses. For example, [NiCl2(PPh3)2] is named as
dichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II).
(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination
entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.
(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the
element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and
Pt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of
the metal ends with the suffix – ate. For example, Co in a complex
2−
anion, Co ( SCN )4  is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin
names are used in the complex anions, e.g., ferrate for Fe.

Coordination Compounds

(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the
complex cation.
The following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination
compounds.
1. [Cr(NH3)3(H2O)3]Cl3 is named as:
triamminetriaquachromium(III) chloride
Explanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is
a cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands
according to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in
the compound, the charge on the complex ion must be +3 (since the
compound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex
ion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation
number of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral
molecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be
the same as the charge of the complex ion, +3.
2. [Co(H2NCH2CH2NH2)3]2(SO4)3 is named as:
tris(ethane-1,2–diamine)cobalt(III) sulphate
Explanation: The sulphate is the counter anion in this molecule.
Since it takes 3 sulphates to bond with two complex cations, the
charge on each complex cation must be +3. Further, ethane-1,2–
diamine is a neutral molecule, so the oxidation number of cobalt
in the complex ion must be +3. Remember that you never have to
indicate the number of cations and anions in the name of an
ionic compound.

Notice how the name of
the metal differs in
cation and anion even
though they contain the
same metal ions.

9 . 4 Isomerism in
Coordination
Compounds

Isomers are two or more compounds that have the same chemical
formula but a different arrangement of atoms. Because of the different
arrangement of atoms, they differ in one or more physical or chemical
properties. Two principal types of isomerism are known among
coordination compounds. Each of which can be further subdivided.
(a) Stereoisomerism

(i) Geometrical isomerism

(ii) Optical isomerism

(b) Structural isomerism

(i) Linkage isomerism
(ii) Coordination isomerism
(iii) Ionisation isomerism
(iv) Solvate isomerism
Stereoisomers have the same chemical formula and chemical
bonds but they have different spatial arrangement. Structural isomers
have different bonds. A detailed account of these isomers are
given below.
9.4.1 Geometric Isomerism

This type of isomerism arises in heteroleptic
complexes due to different possible geometric
arrangements of the ligands. Important examples of
this behaviour are found with coordination numbers
4 and 6. In a square planar complex of formula
[MX2L2] (X and L are unidentate), the two ligands X
may be arranged adjacent to each other in a cis
isomer, or opposite to each other in a trans isomer
as depicted in Fig. 9.2.

Other square planar complex of the type
MABXL (where A, B, X, L are unidentates)
shows three isomers-two cis and one trans.
You may attempt to draw these structures.
Such isomerism is not possible for a tetrahedral
geometry but similar behaviour is possible in
octahedral complexes of formula [MX2L4] in
which the two ligands X may be oriented cis
or trans to each other (Fig. 9.3).

of [CoCl2(en)2 ]

Fig. 9.5
The facial (fac) and
meridional (mer)
isomers of
[Co(NH3 )3(NO2 )3]

This type of isomerism also
arises when didentate ligands
L – L [e.g., NH2 CH2 CH2 NH2 (en)]
are present in complexes of formula
[MX2(L – L)2] (Fig. 9.4).
Another type of geometrical
isomerism occurs in octahedral
coordination entities of the type
[Ma3b3] like [Co(NH3)3(NO2) 3]. If
three donor atoms of the same
ligands occupy adjacent positions
at the corners of an octahedral
face, we have the facial (fac)
isomer. When the positions are
around the meridian of the
octahedron, we get the meridional
(mer) isomer (Fig. 9.5).

Why is geometrical isomerism not possible in tetrahedral complexes
having two different types of unidentate ligands coordinated with
the central metal ion ?

Example 9.4

Tetrahedral complexes do not show geometrical isomerism because
the relative positions of the unidentate ligands attached to the central
metal atom are the same with respect to each other.

Optical Isomerism

Chemistry 252

2022-23

Optical isomers are mirror images that
cannot be superimposed on one
another. These are called as
enantiomers. The molecules or ions
that cannot be superimposed are
called chiral. The two forms are called
dextro (d) and laevo (l) depending
upon the direction they rotate the
plane of polarised light in a
polarimeter (d rotates to the right, l to
the left). Optical isomerism is common
in octahedral complexes involving
didentate ligands (Fig. 9.6).
In a coordination
entity of the type
2+
[PtCl2(en)2] , only the
cis-isomer shows optical
activity (Fig. 9.7).

Solution The two entities are represented as

Out of the two, (a) cis - [CrCl2(ox)2] is chiral (optically active).

9.4.3 Linkage
Isomerism

Linkage isomerism arises in a coordination compound containing
ambidentate ligand. A simple example is provided by complexes
–
containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS , which may bind through the
nitrogen to give M–NCS or through sulphur to give M–SCN. Jørgensen
discovered such behaviour in the complex [Co(NH3)5(NO2)]Cl2, which is
obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through
oxygen (–ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is
bound through nitrogen (–NO2).

9.4.4 Coordination
Isomerism

This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between
cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex.
An example is provided by [Co(NH3)6][Cr(CN)6], in which the NH3 ligands
3+
–
3+
are bound to Co and the CN ligands to Cr . In its coordination
3+
isomer [Cr(NH3)6][Co(CN)6], the NH3 ligands are bound to Cr and the
–
3+
CN ligands to Co .

9.4.5 Ionisation
Isomerism

This form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt
is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then
become the counter ion. An example is provided by the ionisation
isomers [Co(NH3)5(SO4)]Br and [Co(NH3)5Br]SO4.

Coordination Compounds

9.4.6 Solvate
Isomerism

This form of isomerism is known as ‘hydrate isomerism’ in case where
water is involved as a solvent. This is similar to ionisation isomerism.
Solvate isomers differ by whether or not a solvent molecule is directly
bonded to the metal ion or merely present as free solvent molecules
in the crystal lattice. An example is provided by the aqua
complex [Cr(H2O)6]Cl3 (violet) and its solvate isomer [Cr(H2O)5Cl]Cl2.H2O
(grey-green).

9.4 Give evidence that [Co(NH3)5Cl]SO4 and [Co(NH3)5(SO4)]Cl are ionisation
isomers.

9.5 Bonding in
Coordination
Compounds

Werner was the first to describe the bonding features in coordination
compounds. But his theory could not answer basic questions like:
(i) Why only certain elements possess the remarkable property of
forming coordination compounds?
(ii) Why the bonds in coordination compounds have directional
properties?
(iii) Why coordination compounds have characteristic magnetic and
optical properties?
Many approaches have been put forth to explain the nature of
bonding in coordination compounds viz. Valence Bond Theory (VBT),
Crystal Field Theory (CFT), Ligand Field Theory (LFT) and Molecular
Orbital Theory (MOT). We shall focus our attention on elementary
treatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds.

9.5.1 Valence
Bond
Theory

According to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of
ligands can use its (n-1)d, ns, np or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation
to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral,
tetrahedral, square planar and so on (Table 9.2). These hybridised orbitals
are allowed to overlap with ligand orbitals that can donate electron pairs
for bonding. This is illustrated by the following examples.

Square planar

It is usually possible to predict the geometry of a complex from
the knowledge of its
magnetic behaviour on
the basis of the valence
bond theory.
In the diamagnetic
octahedral
complex,
3+
[Co(NH3)6] , the cobalt ion
is in +3 oxidation state
and has the electronic
6
configuration 3d . The
hybridisation scheme is as
shown in diagram.
Six pairs of electrons, one from each NH3 molecule, occupy the six
hybrid orbitals. Thus, the complex has octahedral geometry and is
diamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation
of this complex, since the inner d orbital (3d) is used in hybridisation,
3+
the complex, [Co(NH3)6] is called an inner orbital or low spin or spin
3–
paired complex. The paramagnetic octahedral complex, [CoF6] uses

outer orbital (4d ) in hybridisation (sp d ). It is thus called outer orbital
or high spin or spin free complex. Thus:

for the atomic orbitals involved.
9.5.2 Magnetic
Properties
of
Coordination
Compounds

The magnetic moment of coordination compounds can be measured
by the magnetic susceptibility experiments. The results can be used to
obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons (page 228)
and hence structures adopted by metal complexes.
A critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of
metals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For
3+
1
3+
metal ions with upto three electrons in the d orbitals, like Ti (d ); V
2
3+
3
(d ); Cr (d ); two vacant d orbitals are available for octahedral
hybridisation with 4s and 4p orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these
free ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than
three 3d electrons are present, the required pair of 3d orbitals for
octahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of
4
2+
3+
5
2+
3+
6
2+
3+
Hund’s rule). Thus, for d (Cr , Mn ), d (Mn , Fe ), d (Fe , Co )
cases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3d electrons
which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively.
The magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases,
6
especially with coordination compounds containing d ions. However,
with species containing d4 and d5 ions there are complications. [Mn(CN)6]3–
3–
has magnetic moment of two unpaired electrons while [MnCl6] has a
3–
paramagnetic moment of four unpaired electrons. [Fe(CN)6] has magnetic
3–
moment of a single unpaired electron while [FeF6] has a paramagnetic
3–
moment of five unpaired electrons. [CoF6] is paramagnetic with four
3–
unpaired electrons while [Co(C2O4)3] is diamagnetic. This apparent
anomaly is explained by valence bond theory in terms of formation of
3–
3–
inner orbital and outer orbital coordination entities. [Mn(CN)6] , [Fe(CN)6]

9.5.3 Limitations
of Valence
Bond
Theory

While the VB theory, to a larger extent, explains the formation, structures
and magnetic behaviour of coordination compounds, it suffers from
the following shortcomings:
(i) It involves a number of assumptions.
(ii) It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.
(iii) It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds.
(iv) It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic
or kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds.
(v) It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and
square planar structures of 4-coordinate complexes.
(vi) It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands.

9.5.4 Crystal Field
Theory

The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers
the metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic
interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated
as point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral
molecules. The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion
have same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is
maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges
surrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is
due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules
like NH3 and H2O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the
degeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d
orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal
field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.
(a) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities

In an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding
the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in
metal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands.
Such a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards
the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the d x 2 − y 2
and d z 2 orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of
the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in
energy; and the dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals which are directed between
the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in
the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the d orbitals
has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions
in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, t2g
set and two orbitals of higher energy, eg set. This splitting of the
257

2022-23

Coordination Compounds

degenerate levels due to the
presence of ligands in a
definite geometry is termed as
crystal field splitting and the
energy separation is denoted
by ∆o (the subscript o is for
octahedral) (Fig.9.8). Thus, the
energy of the two eg orbitals
will increase by (3/5) ∆o and
that of the three t2g will
decrease by (2/5)∆o.
The crystal field splitting,
∆o, depends upon the field
produced by the ligand and
charge on the metal ion. Some
ligands are able to produce
strong fields in which case, the
splitting will be large whereas
others produce weak fields
Fig.9.8: d orbital splitting in an octahedral crystal field
and consequently result in
small splitting of d orbitals.
In general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing
field strength as given below:
–
–
–
–
2–
–
–
2–
–
I < Br < SCN < Cl < S < F < OH < C2O4 < H2O < NCS
4–
–
< edta < NH3 < en < CN < CO
Such a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an
experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light
by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the d
orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously,
the single d electron occupies one of the lower energy t2g orbitals. In
2
3
d and d coordination entities, the d electrons occupy the t2g orbitals
singly in accordance with the Hund’s rule. For d4 ions, two possible
patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could
either enter the t2g level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it
could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the
e g level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative
magnitude of the crystal field splitting, ∆o and the pairing energy, P
(P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single
orbital). The two options are:
(i) If ∆o < P, the fourth electron enters one of the eg orbitals giving the
3 1
configuration t 2g e g . Ligands for which ∆o < P are known as weak
field ligands and form high spin complexes.
(ii) If ∆o > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth
4 0
electron to occupy a t2g orbital with configuration t2g eg . Ligands
which produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and
form low spin complexes.
4
7
Calculations show that d to d coordination entities are more
stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.

(b) Crystal field splitting in tetrahedral coordination entities

Fig.9.9: d orbital splitting in a tetrahedral crystal
field.

9.5.5 Colour in
Coordination
Compounds

In tetrahedral coordination entity formation,
the d orbital splitting (Fig. 9.9) is inverted
and is smaller as compared to the octahedral
field splitting. For the same metal, the same
ligands and metal-ligand distances, it can
be shown that ∆t = (4/9) ∆0. Consequently,
the orbital splitting energies are not
sufficiently large for forcing pairing and,
therefore, low spin configurations are rarely
observed. The ‘g’ subscript is used for the
octahedral and square planar complexes
which have centre of symmetry. Since
tetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, ‘g’
subscript is not used with energy levels.

In the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive
properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours.
This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from
white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges
is no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to
that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour
generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by
the complex, it appears red. Table 9.3 gives the relationship of the
different wavelength absorbed and the colour observed.

The colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained
in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex
[Ti(H2O)6]3+, which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex
3+
1
where the single electron (Ti is a 3d system) in the metal d orbital is
in the t2g level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state
available for the electron is the empty eg level. If light corresponding to
the energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would
1
0
0
1
excite the electron from t2g level to the eg level (t2g eg → t2g eg ).
Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 9.10). The
crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds
to d-d transition of the electron.

in the absence of ligand,
crystal field splitting does
not occur and hence the
substance is colourless. For
example, removal of water

it
colourless.
Similarly, anhydrous CuSO4

The crystal field model is successful in explaining the formation,
structures, colour and magnetic properties of coordination compounds
to a large extent. However, from the assumptions that the ligands are
point charges, it follows that anionic ligands should exert the greatest
splitting effect. The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end
of the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account
the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central
atom. These are some of the weaknesses of CFT, which are explained
by ligand field theory (LFT) and molecular orbital theory which are
beyond the scope of the present study.

The metal-carbon bond in metal carbonyls
possess both σ and π character. The M–C σ bond
is formed by the donation of lone pair of electrons
on the carbonyl carbon into a vacant orbital of
the metal. The M–C π bond is formed by the
donation of a pair of electrons from a filled d orbital
of metal into the vacant antibonding π* orbital of
carbon monoxide. The metal to ligand bonding
creates a synergic effect which strengthens the
bond between CO and the metal (Fig.9.14).

The coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds
are widely present in the mineral, plant and animal worlds and are
known to play many important functions in the area of analytical
chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems, industry and medicine. These
are described below:
• Coordination compounds find use in many qualitative and
quantitative chemical analysis. The familiar colour reactions given
by metal ions with a number of ligands (especially chelating ligands),
as a result of formation of coordination entities, form the basis for
their detection and estimation by classical and instrumental methods
of analysis. Examples of such reagents include EDTA, DMG
(dimethylglyoxime), α–nitroso–β–naphthol, cupron, etc.
• Hardness of water is estimated by simple titration with Na2EDTA.
2+
2+
The Ca and Mg ions form stable complexes with EDTA. The
selective estimation of these ions can be done due to difference in
the stability constants of calcium and magnesium complexes.
• Some important extraction processes of metals, like those of silver and
gold, make use of complex formation. Gold, for example, combines with
cyanide in the presence of oxygen and water to form the coordination
–
entity [Au(CN)2] in aqueous solution. Gold can be separated in metallic
form from this solution by the addition of zinc (Unit 6).
• Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation
and subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds.

Coordination compounds are of great importance in biological

Among the other compounds of biological importance with

and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems).
Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial

presence of metals in toxic proportions in plant/animal systems.
Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands
D–penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination

Summary
The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging
area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this
area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and
molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital
insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems.
The first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure
and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory
postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a
metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry
these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent)
bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the
geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.
The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains with reasonable success, the
formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds.
It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour
and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds.
The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on
the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges),
263

2022-23

Coordination Compounds

on the degeneracy of d orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The
splitting of the d orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong
and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of
orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability
parameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges
creates many theoretical difficulties.
The metal–carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both σ and π character.
The ligand to metal is σ bond and metal to ligand is π bond. This unique synergic
bonding provides stability to metal carbonyls.
Coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide
critical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of
biological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in
metallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry.

9.6 In Ni(CO)4, Ni is in zero oxidation state whereas in NiCl4 , it is in +2 oxidation
state. In the presence of CO ligand, the unpaired d electrons of Ni pair up
–
but Cl being a weak ligand is unable to pair up the unpaired electrons.
–

9.7 In presence of CN , (a strong ligand) the 3d electrons pair up leaving only
one unpaired electron. The hybridisation is d2sp3 forming inner orbital
complex. In the presence of H2O, (a weak ligand), 3d electrons do not pair
up. The hybridisation is sp3d2 forming an outer orbital complex containing
five unpaired electrons, it is strongly paramagnetic.
9.8 In the presence of NH3, the 3d electrons pair up leaving two d orbitals
empty to be involved in d2sp3 hybridisation forming inner orbital complex

In Ni(NH3)6 , Ni is in +2 oxidation state and has d configuration,
the hybridisation involved is sp3d2 forming outer orbital complex.
9.9 For square planar shape, the hybridisation is dsp2. Hence the
unpaired electrons in 5d orbital pair up to make one d orbital
empty for dsp2 hybridisation. Thus there is no unpaired electron.
