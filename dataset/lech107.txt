Diversity in chemistry is the hallmark of p–block elements manifested
in their ability to react with the elements of s–, d– and f–blocks as
well as with their own.

In Class XI, you have learnt that the p-block elements
are placed in groups 13 to 18 of the periodic table.
Their valence shell electronic configuration is ns2np1–6
2
(except He which has 1s configuration). The properties
of p-block elements like that of others are greatly
influenced by atomic sizes, ionisation enthalpy, electron
gain enthalpy and electronegativity. The absence of dorbitals in second period and presence of d or d and f
orbitals in heavier elements (starting from third period
onwards) have significant effects on the properties of
elements. In addition, the presence of all the three types
of elements; metals, metalloids and non-metals bring
diversification in chemistry of these elements.
Having learnt the chemistry of elements of Groups
13 and 14 of the p-block of periodic table in Class XI,
you will learn the chemistry of the elements of
subsequent groups in this Unit.

7.1 Group 15
Elements

Group 15 includes nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth
and moscovium. As we go down the group, there is a shift from nonmetallic to metallic through metalloidic character. Nitrogen and
phosphorus are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids, bismuth
and moscovium are typical metals.

7.1.1 Occurrence

Molecular nitrogen comprises 78% by volume of the atmosphere.
In the earth’s crust, it occurs as sodium nitrate, NaNO3 (called Chile
saltpetre) and potassium nitrate (Indian saltpetre). It is found in the
form of proteins in plants and animals. Phosphorus occurs in minerals

of the apatite family, Ca9(PO4)6. CaX2 (X = F, Cl or OH) (e.g., fluorapatite
Ca9 (PO4)6. CaF2) which are the main components of phosphate rocks.
Phosphorus is an essential constituent of animal and plant matter. It
is present in bones as well as in living cells. Phosphoproteins are present
in milk and eggs. Arsenic, antimony and bismuth are found mainly as
sulphide minerals. Moscovium is a synthetic radioactive element. Its
symbol is Mc, atomic number 115, atomic mass 289 and electronic

configuration [Rn] 5f 6d 7s 7p . Due to very short half life and
availability in very little amount, its chemistry is yet to be established.

properties of other elements of this group along with their electronic
configurations are given in Table 7.1.

7.1.2 Electronic
Configuration

The valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is ns np .
The s orbital in these elements is completely filled and p orbitals are
half-filled, making their electronic configuration extra stable.

7.1.3 Atomic and
Ionic Radii

Covalent and ionic (in a particular state) radii increase in size
down the group. There is a considerable increase in covalent radius
from N to P. However, from As to Bi only a small increase in
covalent radius is observed. This is due to the presence of
completely filled d and/or f orbitals in heavier members.

7.1.4 Ionisation
Enthalpy

Ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group due to gradual increase
in atomic size. Because of the extra stable half-filled p orbitals electronic
configuration and smaller size, the ionisation enthalpy of the group 15
elements is much greater than that of group 14 elements in the
corresponding periods. The order of successive ionisation enthalpies,
as expected is ∆iH1 < ∆iH2 < ∆iH3 (Table 7.1).
171 The p-Block Elements

2022-23

7.1.5
Electronegativity

The electronegativity value, in general, decreases down the group with
increasing atomic size. However, amongst the heavier elements, the
difference is not that much pronounced.

7.1.6 Physical
Properties

All the elements of this group are polyatomic. Dinitrogen is a diatomic gas
while all others are solids. Metallic character increases down the group.
Nitrogen and phosphorus are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids
and bismuth is a metal. This is due to decrease in ionisation enthalpy and
increase in atomic size. The boiling points, in general, increase from top to
bottom in the group but the melting point increases upto arsenic and then
decreases upto bismuth. Except nitrogen, all the elements show allotropy.

7.1.7 Chemical
Properties

Oxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity

The common oxidation states of these elements are –3, +3 and +5.
The tendency to exhibit –3 oxidation state decreases down the group due
to increase in size and metallic character. In fact last member of the group,
bismuth hardly forms any compound in –3 oxidation state. The stability
of +5 oxidation state decreases down the group. The only well characterised
Bi (V) compound is BiF5. The stability of +5 oxidation state decreases and
that of +3 state increases (due to inert pair effect) down the group. Besides
+5 oxidation state, nitrogen exhibits + 1, + 2, + 4 oxidation states also
when it reacts with oxygen. However, it does not form compounds in
+5 oxidation state with halogens as nitrogen does not have d-orbitals
to accommodate electrons from other elements to form bonds.
Phosphorus also shows +1 and +4 oxidation states in some oxoacids.
In the case of nitrogen, all oxidation states from +1 to +4 tend to
disproportionate in acid solution. For example,
3HNO2 → HNO3 + H2O + 2NO
Similarly, in case of phosphorus nearly all intermediate oxidation
states disproportionate into +5 and –3 both in alkali and acid. However
+3 oxidation state in case of arsenic, antimony and bismuth becomes
increasingly stable with respect to disproportionation.
Nitrogen is restricted to a maximum covalency of 4 since only four
(one s and three p) orbitals are available for bonding. The heavier elements
have vacant d orbitals in the outermost shell which can be used for
–
bonding (covalency) and hence, expand their covalence as in PF6.
Anomalous properties of nitrogen

Nitrogen differs from the rest of the members of this group due to
its small size, high electronegativity, high ionisation enthalpy and
non-availability of d orbitals. Nitrogen has unique ability to form
pπ -p π multiple bonds with itself and with other elements having
small size and high electronegativity (e.g., C, O). Heavier elements of
this group do not form pπ -pπ bonds as their atomic orbitals are so
large and diffuse that they cannot have effective overlapping.
Thus, nitrogen exists as a diatomic molecule with a triple bond (one
s and two p) between the two atoms. Consequently, its bond enthalpy
–1
(941.4 kJ mol ) is very high. On the contrary, phosphorus, arsenic
and antimony form single bonds as P–P, As–As and Sb–Sb while
bismuth forms metallic bonds in elemental state. However, the single
Chemistry 172

2022-23

N–N bond is weaker than the single P–P bond because of high
interelectronic repulsion of the non-bonding electrons, owing to the
small bond length. As a result the catenation tendency is weaker in
nitrogen. Another factor which affects the chemistry of nitrogen is
the absence of d orbitals in its valence shell. Besides restricting its
covalency to four, nitrogen cannot form dπ –pπ bond as the heavier
elements can e.g., R3P = O or R3P = CH2 (R = alkyl group). Phosphorus
and arsenic can form dπ –dπ bond also with transition metals when
their compounds like P(C2H5) 3 and As(C6H5) 3 act as ligands.
(i) Reactivity towards hydrogen: All the elements of Group 15
form hydrides of the type EH3 where E = N, P, As, Sb or Bi.
Some of the properties of these hydrides are shown in Table
7.2. The hydrides show regular gradation in their properties.
The stability of hydrides decreases from NH3 to BiH3 which can
be observed from their bond dissociation enthalpy.
Consequently, the reducing character of the hydrides increases.
Ammonia is only a mild reducing agent while BiH3 is the
strongest reducing agent amongst all the hydrides. Basicity also
decreases in the order NH3 > PH3 > AsH3 > SbH3 > BiH3. Due to
high electronegativity and small size of nitrogen, NH3 exhibits
hydrogen bonding in solid as well as liquid state. Because of this,
it has higher melting and boiling points than that of PH3.

(ii) Reactivity towards oxygen: All these elements form two types
of oxides: E2O3 and E2O5. The oxide in the higher oxidation state
of the element is more acidic than that of lower oxidation state.
Their acidic character decreases down the group. The oxides of
the type E2O3 of nitrogen and phosphorus are purely acidic,
that of arsenic and antimony amphoteric and those of bismuth
predominantly basic.
(iii) Reactivity towards halogens: These elements react to form two
series of halides: EX3 and EX5. Nitrogen does not form pentahalide
due to non-availability of the d orbitals in its valence shell.
Pentahalides are more covalent than trihalides. This is due to the
fact that in pentahalides +5 oxidation state exists while in the case
of trihalides +3 oxidation state exists. Since elements in +5 oxidation
173 The p-Block Elements

2022-23

state will have more polarising power than in +3 oxidation state,
the covalent character of bonds is more in pentahalides. All the
trihalides of these elements except those of nitrogen are stable.
In case of nitrogen, only NF3 is known to be stable. Trihalides
except BiF3 are predominantly covalent in nature.
(iv) Reactivity towards metals: All these elements react with metals
to form their binary compounds exhibiting –3 oxidation state,
such as, Ca3N2 (calcium nitride) Ca3P2 (calcium phosphide),
Na3As (sodium arsenide), Zn3Sb2 (zinc antimonide) and Mg3Bi2
(magnesium bismuthide).
Though nitrogen exhibits +5 oxidation state, it does not form
pentahalide. Give reason.

Example 7.1

Nitrogen with n = 2, has s and p orbitals only. It does not have d
orbitals to expand its covalence beyond four. That is why it does not
form pentahalide.

Solution

PH3 has lower boiling point than NH3. Why?

Example 7.2
Solution

Unlike NH3, PH3 molecules are not associated through hydrogen bonding
in liquid state. That is why the boiling point of PH3 is lower than NH3.

Intext Questions
7.1 Why are pentahalides of P, As, Sb and Bi more covalent than their
trihalides?
7.2 Why is BiH3 the strongest reducing agent amongst all the hydrides of
Group 15 elements ?

7.2 Dinitrogen

Preparation

Dinitrogen is produced commercially by the liquefaction and fractional
distillation of air. Liquid dinitrogen (b.p. 77.2 K) distils out first leaving
behind liquid oxygen (b.p. 90 K).
In the laboratory, dinitrogen is prepared by treating an aqueous
solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite.
NH4CI(aq) + NaNO2(aq) → N2(g) + 2H2O(l) + NaCl (aq)
Small amounts of NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction;
these impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous
sulphuric acid containing potassium dichromate. It can also be obtained
by the thermal decomposition of ammonium dichromate.

Properties

Dinitrogen is a colourless, odourless, tasteless and non-toxic gas.

15
Nitrogen atom has two stable isotopes: N and N. It has a very low
3
solubility in water (23.2 cm per litre of water at 273 K and 1 bar
pressure) and low freezing and boiling points (Table 7.1).
Dinitrogen is rather inert at room temperature because of the high
bond enthalpy of N ≡ N bond. Reactivity, however, increases rapidly with
rise in temperature. At higher temperatures, it directly combines with
some metals to form predominantly ionic nitrides and with non-metals,
covalent nitrides. A few typical reactions are:

Uses
Uses: The main use of dinitrogen is in the manufacture of ammonia and other
industrial chemicals containing nitrogen, (e.g., calcium cyanamide). It also
finds use where an inert atmosphere is required (e.g., in iron and steel industry,
inert diluent for reactive chemicals). Liquid dinitrogen is used as a refrigerant
to preserve biological materials, food items and in cryosurgery.

Preparation

Ammonia is present in small quantities in air and soil where it is
formed by the decay of nitrogenous organic matter e.g., urea.

NH2 CONH2 + 2H2O → ( NH4 )2CO3  2NH3 + H2O + CO2
On a small scale ammonia is obtained from ammonium salts which
decompose when treated with caustic soda or calcium hydroxide.

In accordance with Le Chatelier’s principle, high pressure would
favour the formation of ammonia. The optimum conditions for the
5
production of ammonia are a pressure of 200 × 10 Pa (about 200
atm), a temperature of ~ 700 K and the use of a catalyst such as iron
oxide with small amounts of K2O and Al2O3 to increase the rate of
attainment of equilibrium. The flow chart for the production of ammonia
is shown in Fig. 7.1. Earlier, iron was used as a catalyst with
molybdenum as a promoter.

Properties
Ammonia is a colourless gas with a pungent odour. Its freezing and
boiling points are 198.4 and 239.7 K respectively. In the solid and
liquid states, it is associated through hydrogen bonds as in the case
of water and that accounts for its higher melting and boiling points
than expected on the basis of its molecular mass. The ammonia molecule
is trigonal pyramidal with the nitrogen atom at the apex. It has three
bond pairs and one lone pair of electrons as shown in the structure.
Ammonia gas is highly soluble in water. Its aqueous solution is

NH3(g) + H2O(l) l NH4 (aq) + OH (aq)
It forms ammonium salts with acids, e.g., NH4Cl, (NH4)2 SO4, etc. As
a weak base, it precipitates the hydroxides (hydrated oxides in case of
some metals) of many metals from their salt solutions. For example,

Uses
Uses: Ammonia is used to produce various nitrogenous fertilisers
(ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulphate)
and in the manufacture of some inorganic nitrogen compounds, the most
important one being nitric acid. Liquid ammonia is also used as a refrigerant.

Example 7.4 Why does NH3 act as a Lewis base ?
Solution Nitrogen atom in NH3 has one lone pair of electrons which
is available for donation. Therefore, it acts as a Lewis base.

7.5 Nitric Acid

Nitrogen forms oxoacids such as H2N 2O 2 (hyponitrous acid), HNO 2
(nitrous acid) and HNO 3 (nitric acid). Amongst them HNO3 is the
most important.
Preparation

In the laboratory, nitric acid is prepared by heating KNO3 or NaNO3
and concentrated H2SO4 in a glass retort.
NaNO3 + H2 SO4 → NaHSO4 + HNO3
On a large scale it is prepared mainly by Ostwald’s process.
This method is based upon catalytic oxidation of NH3 by atmospheric
oxygen.

Nitrogen dioxide so formed, dissolves in water to give HNO3.

3NO2 ( g ) + H2 O ( l ) → 2HNO3 ( aq ) + NO ( g )
NO thus formed is recycled and the aqueous HNO 3 can be
concentrated by distillation upto ~ 68% by mass. Further
concentration to 98% can be achieved by dehydration with
concentrated H 2SO4.
Properties

It is a colourless liquid (f.p. 231.4 K and b.p. 355.6 K). Laboratory
grade nitric acid contains ~ 68% of the HNO3 by mass and has a
specific gravity of 1.504.
In the gaseous state, HNO3 exists as a planar molecule with
the structure as shown.
In aqueous solution, nitric acid behaves as a strong acid giving
hydronium and nitrate ions.

Concentrated nitric acid is a strong oxidising agent and attacks

temperature and the nature of the material undergoing oxidation.
3Cu + 8 HNO3(dilute) → 3Cu(NO3)2 + 2NO + 4H2O
Cu + 4HNO3(conc.) → Cu(NO3)2 + 2NO2 + 2H2O
Zinc reacts with dilute nitric acid to give N2O and with concentrated

4Zn + 10HNO3(dilute) → 4 Zn (NO3)2 + 5H2O + N2O
Zn + 4HNO3(conc.) → Zn (NO3)2 + 2H2O + 2NO2
Some metals (e.g., Cr, Al) do not dissolve in concentrated nitric
acid because of the formation of a passive film of oxide on the surface.
Concentrated nitric acid also oxidises non–metals and their
compounds. Iodine is oxidised to iodic acid, carbon to carbon dioxide,
sulphur to H2SO4, and phosphorus to phosphoric acid.
I2 + 10HNO3 → 2HIO3 + 10NO2 + 4H2O

P4 + 20HNO3 → 4H3PO4 + 20NO2 + 4H2O
Brown Ring Test: The familiar brown ring test for nitrates depends
2+
on the ability of Fe to reduce nitrates to nitric oxide, which reacts
2+
with Fe to form a brown coloured complex. The test is usually carried
out by adding dilute ferrous sulphate solution to an aqueous solution
containing nitrate ion, and then carefully adding concentrated sulphuric
acid along the sides of the test tube. A brown ring at the interface
between the solution and sulphuric acid layers indicates the presence
of nitrate ion in solution.

Uses
Uses: The major use of nitric acid is in the manufacture of ammonium nitrate
for fertilisers and other nitrates for use in explosives and pyrotechnics. It is
also used for the preparation of nitroglycerin, trinitrotoluene and other organic
nitro compounds. Other major uses are in the pickling of stainless steel,
etching of metals and as an oxidiser in rocket fuels.

7.6 Phosphorus —
Allotropic
Forms

Phosphorus is found in many allotropic forms, the important ones
being white, red and black.
White phosphorus is a translucent white waxy solid. It is poisonous,
insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulphide and glows in dark
(chemiluminescence). It dissolves in boiling NaOH solution in an inert
atmosphere giving PH3.

White phosphorus is less stable and therefore, more reactive than
the other solid phases under normal conditions because of angular
strain in the P4 molecule where the angles are only 60°. It readily

7.7 Phosphine

Preparation

Phosphine is prepared by the reaction of calcium phosphide with water
or dilute HCl.
Ca3P2 + 6H2O → 3Ca(OH)2 + 2PH3
Ca3P2 + 6HCl → 3CaCl2 + 2PH3
In the laboratory, it is prepared by heating white phosphorus with
concentrated NaOH solution in an inert atmosphere of CO2.

P4 + 3NaOH + 3H2O → PH3 + 3NaH2 PO2

( sodium hypophosphite )
When pure, it is non inflammable but becomes inflammable owing
to the presence of P2H4 or P4 vapours. To purify it from the impurities,
it is absorbed in HI to form phosphonium iodide (PH4I) which on treating
with KOH gives off phosphine.
PH 4 I + KOH → KI + H 2 O + PH 3
Properties

It is a colourless gas with rotten fish smell and is highly poisonous.
It explodes in contact with traces of oxidising agents like HNO3, Cl2 and
Br2 vapours.
It is slightly soluble in water. The solution of PH3 in water decomposes
in presence of light giving red phosphorus and H2. When absorbed in
181 The p-Block Elements

copper sulphate or mercuric chloride solution, the corresponding
phosphides are obtained.
3CuSO 4 + 2PH3 → Cu3 P2 + 3H 2 SO 4
3HgCl2 + 2PH 3 → Hg 3 P2 + 6HCl

Phosphine is weakly basic and like ammonia, gives phosphonium
compounds with acids e.g.,
PH3 + HBr → PH 4 Br

Uses
Uses: The spontaneous combustion of phosphine is technically used in Holme’s
signals. Containers containing calcium carbide and calcium phosphide are pierced
and thrown in the sea when the gases evolved burn and serve as a signal. It is also
used in smoke screens.
In what way can it be proved that PH3 is basic in nature?

Example 7.6
Solution

PH3 reacts with acids like HI to form PH4I which shows that it is
basic in nature.
PH3 + HI → PH 4 I

The compositions of the oxoacids are interrelated in terms of loss
or gain of H2O molecule or O-atom. The structures of some important
oxoacids are given next.
In oxoacids phosphorus is tetrahedrally surrounded by other atoms.
All these acids contain at least one P=O bond and one P–OH bond. The
oxoacids in which phosphorus has lower oxidation state (less than +5)
contain, in addition to P=O and P–OH bonds, either P–P (e.g., in H4P2O6)
or P–H (e.g., in H3PO2) bonds but not both. These acids in +3 oxidation
state of phosphorus tend to disproportionate to higher and lower
oxidation states. For example, orthophophorous acid (or phosphorous
acid) on heating disproportionates to give orthophosphoric acid (or
phosphoric acid) and phosphine.

The acids which contain P–H bond have strong reducing properties.
Thus, hypophosphorous acid is a good reducing agent as it contains
two P–H bonds and reduces, for example, AgNO3 to metallic silver.
4 AgNO3 + 2H2O + H3PO2 → 4Ag + 4HNO3 + H3PO4
+

These P–H bonds are not ionisable to give H and do not play any
role in basicity. Only those H atoms which are attached with oxygen in
P–OH form are ionisable and cause the basicity. Thus, H3PO3 and
H3PO4 are dibasic and tribasic, respectively as the structure of H3PO3
has two P–OH bonds and H3PO4 three.

Example 7.9 How do you account for the reducing behaviour
of H3PO2 on the basis of its structure ?

Solution In H3PO2, two H atoms are bonded directly to P
atom which imparts reducing character to the acid.

7.10 Group 16
Elements

Oxygen, sulphur, selenium, tellurium, polonium and livermorium
constitute Group 16 of the periodic table. This is sometimes known as
group of chalcogens. The name is derived from the Greek word for
brass and points to the association of sulphur and its congeners with
copper. Most copper minerals contain either oxygen or sulphur and
frequently the other members of the group.
185 The p-Block Elements

2022-23

7.10.1 Occurrence

Oxygen is the most abundant of all the elements on earth. Oxygen
forms about 46.6% by mass of earth’s crust. Dry air contains 20.946%
oxygen by volume.
However, the abundance of sulphur in the earth’s crust is only
0.03-0.1%. Combined sulphur exists primarily as sulphates such as
gypsum CaSO4.2H2O, epsom salt MgSO4.7H2O, baryte BaSO4 and
sulphides such as galena PbS, zinc blende ZnS, copper pyrites CuFeS2.
Traces of sulphur occur as hydrogen sulphide in volcanoes. Organic
materials such as eggs, proteins, garlic, onion, mustard, hair and wool
contain sulphur.
Selenium and tellurium are also found as metal selenides and
tellurides in sulphide ores. Polonium occurs in nature as a decay
product of thorium and uranium minerals. Livermorium is a synthetic
radioactive element. Its symbol is Lv, atomic number 116, atomic mass

292 and electronic configuration [Rn] 5f 6d 7s 7p . It has been
produced only in a very small amount and has very short half-life (only
a small fraction of one second). This limits the study of properlies of Lv.
Here, except for livermorium, important atomic and physical
properties of other elements of Group16 along with their electronic
configurations are given in Table 7.6. Some of the atomic, physical and
chemical properties and their trends are discussed below.

Configuration

The elements of Group16 have six electrons in the outermost shell and
2
4
have ns np general electronic configuration.

7.10.3 Atomic
and Ionic
Radii

Due to increase in the number of shells, atomic and ionic radii increase
from top to bottom in the group. The size of oxygen atom is, however,
exceptionally small.

Chemistry 186

2022-23

7.10.4 Ionisation
Enthalpy

Ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group. It is due to increase in
size. However, the elements of this group have lower ionisation enthalpy
values compared to those of Group15 in the corresponding periods.
This is due to the fact that Group 15 elements have extra stable halffilled p orbitals electronic configurations.

7.10.5 Electron
Gain
Enthalpy

Because of the compact nature of oxygen atom, it has less negative
electron gain enthalpy than sulphur. However, from sulphur onwards
the value again becomes less negative upto polonium.

7.10.6
Electronegativity

Next to fluorine, oxygen has the highest electronegativity value amongst
the elements. Within the group, electronegativity decreases with an
increase in atomic number. This implies that the metallic character
increases from oxygen to polonium.

Elements of Group 16 generally show lower value of first ionisation
enthalpy compared to the corresponding periods of group 15. Why?

Example 7.10

Due to extra stable half-filled p orbitals electronic configurations of
Group 15 elements, larger amount of energy is required to remove
electrons compared to Group 16 elements.

Solution

7.10.7 Physical
Properties

Some of the physical properties of Group 16 elements are given in
Table 7.6. Oxygen and sulphur are non-metals, selenium and tellurium
metalloids, whereas polonium is a metal. Polonium is radioactive and
is short lived (Half-life 13.8 days). All these elements exhibit allotropy.
The melting and boiling points increase with an increase in atomic
number down the group. The large difference between the melting and
boiling points of oxygen and sulphur may be explained on the basis
of their atomicity; oxygen exists as diatomic molecule (O2) whereas
sulphur exists as polyatomic molecule (S8).

7.10.8 Chemical
Properties

Oxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity

The elements of Group 16 exhibit a number of oxidation states (Table
7.6). The stability of -2 oxidation state decreases down the group.
Polonium hardly shows –2 oxidation state. Since electronegativity of
oxygen is very high, it shows only negative oxidation state as –2 except
in the case of OF2 where its oxidation state is + 2. Other elements of the
group exhibit + 2, + 4, + 6 oxidation states but + 4 and + 6 are more
common. Sulphur, selenium and tellurium usually show + 4 oxidation
state in their compounds with oxygen and + 6 with fluorine. The stability
of + 6 oxidation state decreases down the group and stability of + 4
oxidation state increases (inert pair effect). Bonding in +4 and +6
oxidation states is primarily covalent.
Anomalous behaviour of oxygen

The anomalous behaviour of oxygen, like other members of p-block
present in second period is due to its small size and high
electronegativity. One typical example of effects of small size and high
electronegativity is the presence of strong hydrogen bonding in H2O
which is not found in H2S.
187 The p-Block Elements

2022-23

The absence of d orbitals in oxygen limits its covalency to four and
in practice, rarely exceeds two. On the other hand, in case of other
elements of the group, the valence shells can be expanded and covalence
exceeds four.
(i) Reactivity with hydrogen: All the elements of Group 16 form
hydrides of the type H2E (E = O, S, Se, Te, Po). Some properties of
hydrides are given in Table 7.7. Their acidic character increases
from H2O to H2Te. The increase in acidic character can be explained
in terms of decrease in bond enthalpy for the dissociation of H–E
bond down the group. Owing to the decrease in enthalpy for the
dissociation of H–E bond down the group, the thermal stability of
hydrides also decreases from H2O to H2Po. All the hydrides except
water possess reducing property and this character increases from
H2S to H2Te.

(ii) Reactivity with oxygen: All these elements form oxides of the EO2
and EO3 types where E = S, Se, Te or Po. Ozone (O3) and sulphur
dioxide (SO2) are gases while selenium dioxide (SeO2) is solid.
Reducing property of dioxide decreases from SO2 to TeO2; SO2 is
reducing while TeO2 is an oxidising agent. Besides EO2 type,
sulphur, selenium and tellurium also form EO3 type oxides (SO3,
SeO3, TeO3). Both types of oxides are acidic in nature.
(iii) Reactivity towards the halogens: Elements of Group 16 form a
large number of halides of the type, EX6, EX4 and EX2 where E is
an element of the group and X is a halogen. The stability of the
–
–
–
–
halides decreases in the order F > Cl > Br > I . Amongst hexahalides,
hexafluorides are the only stable halides. All hexafluorides are
gaseous in nature. They have octahedral structure. Sulphur
hexafluoride, SF6 is exceptionally stable for steric reasons.
Amongst tetrafluorides, SF4 is a gas, SeF4 a liquid and TeF4 a solid.
3
These fluorides have sp d hybridisation and thus, have trigonal
bipyramidal structures in which one of the equatorial positions is
occupied by a lone pair of electrons. This geometry is also regarded as
see-saw geometry.
All elements except oxygen form dichlorides and dibromides. These
3
dihalides are formed by sp hybridisation and thus, have tetrahedral
structure. The well known monohalides are dimeric in nature. Examples

Preparation

Dioxygen can be obtained in the laboratory by the following ways:
(i) By heating oxygen containing salts such as chlorates, nitrates and
permanganates.
Heat

→ 2KCl + 3O2

(ii) By the thermal decomposition of the oxides of metals low in the

2Ag2O(s) → 4Ag(s) + O2(g);
2Pb3O4(s) → 6PbO(s) + O2(g)
2HgO(s) → 2Hg(l) + O2(g) ;
2PbO2(s) → 2PbO(s) + O2(g)
(iii) Hydrogen peroxide is readily decomposed into water and dioxygen
by catalysts such as finely divided metals and manganese dioxide.
2H2O2(aq) → 2H2O(1) + O2(g)
On large scale it can be prepared from water or air. Electrolysis of
water leads to the release of hydrogen at the cathode and oxygen
at the anode.
Industrially, dioxygen is obtained from air by first removing carbon
dioxide and water vapour and then, the remaining gases are liquefied
and fractionally distilled to give dinitrogen and dioxygen.
Properties

Dioxygen is a colourless and odourless gas. Its solubility in water is to
3
3
the extent of 3.08 cm in 100 cm water at 293 K which is just sufficient
for the vital support of marine and aquatic life. It liquefies at 90 K and
16
17
freezes at 55 K. Oxygen atom has three stable isotopes: O, O and
18
O. Molecular oxygen, O2 is unique in being paramagnetic inspite of
having even number of electrons (see Class XI Chemistry Book, Unit 4).
Dioxygen directly reacts with nearly all metals and non-metals
except some metals ( e.g., Au, Pt) and some noble gases. Its combination
with other elements is often strongly exothermic which helps in
sustaining the reaction. However, to initiate the reaction, some external

double bond is high (493.4 kJ mol ).

P4 + 5O2 → P4 O10
C + O 2 → CO 2

Uses
Uses: In addition to its importance in normal respiration and combustion
processes, oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding, in the manufacture of
many metals, particularly steel. Oxygen cylinders are widely used in hospitals,
high altitude flying and in mountaineering. The combustion of fuels, e.g.,
hydrazines in liquid oxygen, provides tremendous thrust in rockets.

7.12 Simple
Oxides

A binary compound of oxygen with another element is called oxide. As
already stated, oxygen reacts with most of the elements of the periodic
table to form oxides. In many cases one element forms two or more
oxides. The oxides vary widely in their nature and properties.
Oxides can be simple (e.g., MgO, Al2O3 ) or mixed (Pb3O4, Fe3O4).
Simple oxides can be classified on the basis of their acidic, basic or
amphoteric character. An oxide that combines with water to give an
acid is termed acidic oxide (e.g., SO2, Cl2O7, CO2, N2O5 ). For example,
SO2 combines with water to give H2SO3, an acid.
SO2 + H2 O → H2 SO3
As a general rule, only non-metal oxides are acidic but oxides of
some metals in high oxidation state also have acidic character (e.g.,
Mn2O7, CrO3, V2O5). The oxides which give a base with water are known
as basic oxides (e.g., Na2O, CaO, BaO). For example, CaO combines
with water to give Ca(OH)2, a base.
CaO + H2 O → Ca (OH )2

Chemistry 190

2022-23

In general, metallic oxides are basic.
Some metallic oxides exhibit a dual behaviour. They show
characteristics of both acidic as well as basic oxides. Such oxides are
known as amphoteric oxides. They react with acids as well as alkalies.
For example, Al2O3 reacts with acids as well as alkalies.
Al 2O3 (s ) + 6HCl (aq ) + 9H2 O ( l ) → 2 [ Al(H2O)6 ]

3+

(aq ) + 6Cl − ( aq )
Al 2O3 (s ) + 6NaOH ( aq ) + 3H2O ( l ) → 2Na 3 [ Al (OH )6 ] (aq )
There are some oxides which are neither acidic nor basic. Such oxides
are known as neutral oxides. Examples of neutral oxides are CO, NO
and N2O.

7.13 Ozone

Ozone is an allotropic form of oxygen. It is too reactive to remain for
long in the atmosphere at sea level. At a height of about 20 kilometres,
it is formed from atmospheric oxygen in the presence of sunlight. This
ozone layer protects the earth’s surface from an excessive concentration
of ultraviolet (UV) radiations.
Preparation

When a slow dry stream of oxygen is passed through a silent electrical
discharge, conversion of oxygen to ozone (10%) occurs. The product is
known as ozonised oxygen.

Since the formation of ozone from oxygen is an endothermic process,
it is necessary to use a silent electrical discharge in its preparation to
prevent its decomposition.
If concentrations of ozone greater than 10 per cent are required, a
battery of ozonisers can be used, and pure ozone (b.p. 101.1K) can be
condensed in a vessel surrounded by liquid oxygen.
Properties

Pure ozone is a pale blue gas, dark blue liquid and violet-black solid.
Ozone has a characteristic smell and in small concentrations it is harmless.
However, if the concentration rises above about 100 parts per million,
breathing becomes uncomfortable resulting in headache and nausea.
Ozone is thermodynamically unstable with respect to oxygen since
its decomposition into oxygen results in the liberation of heat (∆H is
negative) and an increase in entropy (∆S is positive). These two effects
reinforce each other, resulting in large negative Gibbs energy change
(∆G) for its conversion into oxygen. It is not really surprising, therefore,
high concentrations of ozone can be dangerously explosive.
Due to the ease with which it liberates atoms of nascent oxygen
(O3 → O2 + O), it acts as a powerful oxidising agent. For example, it
oxidises lead sulphide to lead sulphate and iodide ions to iodine.
PbS(s) + 4O3(g) → PbSO4(s) + 4O2(g)
2I–(aq) + H2O(l) + O3(g) →2OH–(aq) + I2(s) + O2(g)
When ozone reacts with an excess of potassium iodide solution
buffered with a borate buffer (pH 9.2), iodine is liberated which can be
titrated against a standard solution of sodium thiosulphate. This is a
quantitative method for estimating O3 gas.

Experiments have shown that nitrogen oxides (particularly nitrogen
monoxide) combine very rapidly with ozone and there is, thus, the
possibility that nitrogen oxides emitted from the exhaust systems of
supersonic jet aeroplanes might be slowly depleting the concentration
of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.

NO ( g ) + O3 ( g ) → NO2 ( g ) + O2 ( g )
Another threat to this ozone layer is probably posed by the use of
freons which are used in aerosol sprays and as refrigerants.
The two oxygen-oxygen bond lengths in the ozone
molecule are identical (128 pm) and the molecule is angular
o
as expected with a bond angle of about 117 . It is a resonance
hybrid of two main forms:

Uses
Uses: It is used as a germicide, disinfectant and for sterilising water. It is also
used for bleaching oils, ivory, flour, starch, etc. It acts as an oxidising agent

7.14 Sulphur —
Allotropic
Forms

Sulphur forms numerous allotropes of which the yellow rhombic
(α-sulphur) and monoclinic (β -sulphur) forms are the most important.
The stable form at room temperature is rhombic sulphur, which
transforms to monoclinic sulphur when heated above 369 K.
Rhombic sulphur (α
α-sulphur)

This allotrope is yellow in colour, m.p. 385.8 K and specific gravity
2.06. Rhombic sulphur crystals are formed on evaporating the solution
of roll sulphur in CS2. It is insoluble in water but dissolves to some
extent in benzene, alcohol and ether. It is readily soluble in CS2.
β-sulphur)
Monoclinic sulphur (β

Its m.p. is 393 K and specific gravity 1.98. It is soluble in CS2. This
form of sulphur is prepared by melting rhombic sulphur in a dish
and cooling, till crust is formed. Two holes are made in the crust and
the remaining liquid poured out. On removing the crust, colourless
needle shaped crystals of β-sulphur are formed. It is stable above 369 K
and transforms into α-sulphur below it. Conversely, α-sulphur is stable
below 369 K and transforms into β-sulphur above this. At 369 K both
the forms are stable. This temperature is called transition temperature.
Both rhombic and monoclinic sulphur have S8 molecules. These S8
molecules are packed to give different crystal structures. The S8 ring
in both the forms is puckered and has a crown shape. The molecular
dimensions are given in Fig. 7.5(a).

7.15 Sulphur
Dioxide

Preparation

Sulphur dioxide is formed together with a little (6-8%) sulphur trioxide
when sulphur is burnt in air or oxygen:
S(s) + O2(g) → SO2 (g)
In the laboratory it is readily generated by treating a sulphite with
dilute sulphuric acid.
SO32-(aq) + 2H+ (aq) → H2O(l) + SO2 (g)
Industrially, it is produced as a by-product of the roasting of
sulphide ores.
4FeS2 (s ) + 11O2 ( g ) → 2Fe2 O3 ( s ) + 8SO2 ( g )
The gas after drying is liquefied under pressure and stored in steel cylinders.
Properties

Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas with pungent smell and is highly
soluble in water. It liquefies at room temperature under a pressure of
two atmospheres and boils at 263 K.
Sulphur dioxide, when passed through water, forms a solution of
sulphurous acid.
SO2 ( g ) + H2 O ( l )  H2 SO3 ( aq )
It reacts readily with sodium hydroxide solution, forming sodium
sulphite, which then reacts with more sulphur dioxide to form sodium
hydrogen sulphite.
2NaOH + SO2 → Na2SO3 + H2O
Na2SO3 + H2O + SO2 → 2NaHSO3
In its reaction with water and alkalies, the behaviour of sulphur
dioxide is very similar to that of carbon dioxide.

Sulphur dioxide reacts with chlorine in the presence of charcoal (which
acts as a catalyst) to give sulphuryl chloride, SO2Cl2. It is oxidised to
sulphur trioxide by oxygen in the presence of vanadium(V) oxide catalyst.

When moist, sulphur dioxide behaves as a reducing agent. For
example, it converts iron(III) ions to iron(II) ions and decolourises
acidified potassium permanganate(VII) solution; the latter reaction is a
convenient test for the gas.

2Fe3+ + SO2 + 2H2 O → 2Fe 2+ + SO24− + 4H +
5SO2 + 2MnO−4 + 2H2 O → 5SO42− + 4H+ + 2Mn2 +
The molecule of SO2 is angular. It is a resonance hybrid
of the two canonical forms:

Uses
Uses: Sulphur dioxide is used (i) in refining petroleum and sugar (ii) in bleaching
wool and silk and (iii) as an anti-chlor, disinfectant and preservative. Sulphuric
acid, sodium hydrogen sulphite and calcium hydrogen sulphite (industrial
chemicals) are manufactured from sulphur dioxide. Liquid SO2 is used as a
solvent to dissolve a number of organic and inorganic chemicals.

H2S2O5, H2SxO6 (x = 2 to 5), H2SO4, H2S2O7, H2SO5, H2S2O8 . Some of
these acids are unstable and cannot be isolated. They are known in
aqueous solution or in the form of their salts. Structures of some
important oxoacids are shown in Fig. 7.6.

7.17 Sulphuric
Acid

Manufacture

Sulphuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals
worldwide.
Sulphuric acid is manufactured by the Contact Process which involves
three steps:
(i) burning of sulphur or sulphide ores in air to generate SO2.
(ii) conversion of SO2 to SO3 by the reaction with oxygen in the presence
of a catalyst (V2O5), and
(iii) absorption of SO3 in H2SO4 to give Oleum (H2S2O7).
A flow diagram for the manufacture of sulphuric acid is shown in
(Fig. 7.7). The SO2 produced is purified by removing dust and other
impurities such as arsenic compounds.
The key step in the manufacture of H2SO4 is the catalytic oxidation
of SO2 with O2 to give SO3 in the presence of V2O5 (catalyst).
V2O5
2SO2 ( g ) + O2 ( g ) 

→ 2SO3 ( g ) ∆ r H 0 = −196.6 kJmol −1

The reaction is exothermic, reversible and the forward reaction leads
to a decrease in volume. Therefore, low temperature and high pressure
are the favourable conditions for maximum yield. But the temperature
should not be very low otherwise rate of reaction will become slow.
In practice, the plant is operated at a pressure of 2 bar and a
temperature of 720 K. The SO3 gas from the catalytic converter is
absorbed in concentrated H2SO4 to produce oleum. Dilution of oleum
with water gives H2SO4 of the desired concentration. In the industry
two steps are carried out simultaneously to make the process a
continuous one and also to reduce the cost.
SO3 + H2SO4 → H2S2O7

Properties

Sulphuric acid is a colourless, dense, oily liquid with a specific gravity
of 1.84 at 298 K. The acid freezes at 283 K and boils at 611 K. It
dissolves in water with the evolution of a large quantity of heat. Hence,
care must be taken while preparing sulphuric acid solution from
concentrated sulphuric acid. The concentrated acid must be added
slowly into water with constant stirring.
The chemical reactions of sulphuric acid are as a result of the
following characteristics: (a) low volatility (b) strong acidic character
(c) strong affinity for water and (d) ability to act as an oxidising agent.
In aqueous solution, sulphuric acid ionises in two steps.

HSO4 (aq) + H2O(l) → H3O (aq) + SO4 (aq) ; K a2 = 1.2 × 10

–2

The larger value of K a1 ( K a1 >10) means that H2SO4 is largely
–
+
dissociated into H and HSO4 . Greater the value of dissociation constant
(Ka), the stronger is the acid.
The acid forms two series of salts: normal sulphates (such as sodium
sulphate and copper sulphate) and acid sulphates (e.g., sodium
hydrogen sulphate).
Sulphuric acid, because of its low volatility can be used to
manufacture more volatile acids from their corresponding salts.
2 MX + H2SO4 → 2 HX + M2SO4 (X = F, Cl, NO3)
(M = Metal)

Concentrated sulphuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent. Many
wet gases can be dried by passing them through sulphuric acid,
provided the gases do not react with the acid. Sulphuric acid removes
water from organic compounds; it is evident by its charring action on
carbohydrates.
H2 SO4
C12H22O11 
→ 12C + 11H2O

Hot concentrated sulphuric acid is a moderately strong oxidising
agent. In this respect, it is intermediate between phosphoric and nitric
acids. Both metals and non-metals are oxidised by concentrated
sulphuric acid, which is reduced to SO2.
Cu + 2 H2SO4(conc.) → CuSO4 + SO2 + 2H2O
S + 2H2SO4(conc.) → 3SO2 + 2H2O
C + 2H2SO4(conc.) → CO2 + 2 SO2 + 2 H2O

Uses
Uses: Sulphuric acid is a very important industrial chemical. A nation’s
industrial strength can be judged by the quantity of sulphuric acid it
produces and consumes. It is needed for the manufacture of hundreds
of other compounds and also in many industrial processes. The bulk
of sulphuric acid produced is used in the manufacture of fertilisers
(e.g., ammonium sulphate, superphosphate). Other uses are in:
(a) petroleum refining (b) manufacture of pigments, paints and dyestuff
intermediates (c) detergent industry (d) metallurgical applications (e.g.,
cleansing metals before enameling, electroplating and galvanising
(e) storage batteries (f) in the manufacture of nitrocellulose products
and (g) as a laboratory reagent.

7.18 Group 17
Elements

Fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine and tennessine are
members of Group 17. These are collectively known as the halogens
(Greek halo means salt and genes means born i.e., salt producers).
The halogens are highly reactive non-metallic elements. Like Groups
1 and 2, the elements of Group 17 show great similarity amongst
themselves. That much similarity is not found in the elements of
other groups of the periodic table. Also, there is a regular gradation
in their physical and chemical properties. Astatine and tennessine are
radioactive elements.

7.18.1 Occurrence

Fluorine and chlorine are fairly abundant while bromine and iodine
less so. Fluorine is present mainly as insoluble fluorides (fluorspar
CaF2, cryolite Na3AlF6 and fluoroapatite 3Ca3(PO4) 2.CaF2) and small
quantities are present in soil, river water plants and bones and teeth
of animals. Sea water contains chlorides, bromides and iodides of
sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, but is mainly sodium
chloride solution (2.5% by mass). The deposits of dried up seas
contain these compounds, e.g., sodium chloride and carnallite,
KCl.MgCl2.6H2O. Certain forms of marine life contain iodine in their
systems; various seaweeds, for example, contain upto 0.5% of iodine
and Chile saltpetre contains upto 0.2% of sodium iodate.
Here important atomic and physical properties of Group 17 elements
other than tennessine are given along with their electronic configurations
[Table 7.8, page 198]. Tennessine is a synthetic radioactive element. Its

7.18.2 Electronic
All these elements have seven electrons in their outermost shell (ns np )
Configuration which is one electron short of the next noble gas.

7.18.3 Atomic
and Ionic
Radii

The halogens have the smallest atomic radii in their respective periods
due to maximum effective nuclear charge. The atomic radius of fluorine
like the other elements of second period is extremely small. Atomic and
ionic radii increase from fluorine to iodine due to increasing number
of quantum shells.

7.18.4 Ionisation
Enthalpy

They have little tendency to lose electron. Thus they have very high
ionisation enthalpy. Due to increase in atomic size, ionisation enthalpy
decreases down the group.

7.18.5 Electron
Gain
Enthalpy

Halogens have maximum negative electron gain enthalpy in the
corresponding periods. This is due to the fact that the atoms of these
elements have only one electron less than stable noble gas configurations.
Electron gain enthalpy of the elements of the group becomes less negative
down the group. However, the negative electron gain enthalpy of fluorine
is less than that of chlorine. It is due to small size of fluorine atom. As
a result, there are strong interelectronic repulsions in the relatively
small 2p orbitals of fluorine and thus, the incoming electron does not
experience much attraction.

Chemistry 198

2022-23

7.18.6
Electronegativity

They have very high electronegativity. The electronegativity decreases
down the group. Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the
periodic table.

Halogens have maximum negative electron gain enthalpy in the
respective periods of the periodic table. Why?

Example 7.14

Halogens have the smallest size in their respective periods and therefore
high effective nuclear charge. As a consequence, they readily accept
one electron to acquire noble gas electronic configuration.

Solution

7.18.7 Physical
Properties

Halogens display smooth variations in their physical properties. Fluorine
and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid. Their
melting and boiling points steadily increase with atomic number. All
halogens are coloured. This is due to absorption of radiations in visible
region which results in the excitation of outer electrons to higher energy
level. By absorbing different quanta of radiation, they display different
colours. For example, F2, has yellow, Cl2 , greenish yellow, Br2, red and
I2, violet colour. Fluorine and chlorine react with water. Bromine and
iodine are only sparingly soluble in water but are soluble in various
organic solvents such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon
disulphide and hydrocarbons to give coloured solutions.
One curious anomaly we notice from Table 7.8 is the smaller
enthalpy of dissociation of F2 compared to that of Cl2 whereas X-X
bond dissociation enthalpies from chlorine onwards show the expected
trend: Cl – Cl > Br – Br > I – I. A reason for this anomaly is the relatively
large electron-electron repulsion among the lone pairs in F2 molecule
where they are much closer to each other than in case of Cl2.

Example 7.15

Although electron gain enthalpy of fluorine is less negative as compared
to chlorine, fluorine is a stronger oxidising agent than chlorine. Why?

Solution

It is due to
(i) low enthalpy of dissociation of F-F bond (Table 7.8).
–
(ii) high hydration enthalpy of F (Table 7.8).

199 The p-Block Elements

2022-23

The higher oxidation states of chlorine, bromine and iodine are realised
mainly when the halogens are in combination with the small and highly
electronegative fluorine and oxygen atoms. e.g., in interhalogens, oxides
and oxoacids. The oxidation states of +4 and +6 occur in the oxides and
oxoacids of chlorine and bromine. The fluorine atom has no d orbitals
in its valence shell and therefore cannot expand its octet. Being the most
electronegative, it exhibits only –1 oxidation state.
All the halogens are highly reactive. They react with metals and
non-metals to form halides. The reactivity of the halogens decreases
down the group.
The ready acceptance of an electron is the reason for the strong
oxidising nature of halogens. F2 is the strongest oxidising halogen and
it oxidises other halide ions in solution or even in the solid phase. In
general, a halogen oxidises halide ions of higher atomic number.
–
–
F2 + 2X → 2F + X2 (X = Cl, Br or I)
–
–
Cl2 + 2X → 2Cl + X2 (X = Br or I)
–
–
Br2 + 2I → 2Br + I2
The decreasing oxidising ability of the halogens in aqueous solution
down the group is evident from their standard electrode potentials
(Table 7.8) which are dependent on the parameters indicated below:

The relative oxidising power of halogens can further be illustrated
by their reactions with water. Fluorine oxidises water to oxygen whereas
chlorine and bromine react with water to form corresponding hydrohalic
and hypohalous acids. The reaction of iodine with water is non–
spontaneous. In fact, I can be oxidised by oxygen in acidic medium;
just the reverse of the reaction observed with fluorine.

2F2 ( g ) + 2H2O ( l ) → 4H+ ( aq ) + 4F − ( aq ) + O2 ( g )
X 2 ( g ) + H2 O ( l ) → HX ( aq ) + HOX ( aq )

( where X = Cl or Br )
4I− ( aq ) + 4H + ( aq ) + O2 ( g ) → 2I2 ( s ) + 2H2O ( l )
Anomalous behaviour of fluorine

Like other elements of p-block present in second period of the periodic
table, fluorine is anomalous in many properties. For example, ionisation
enthalpy, electronegativity, and electrode potentials are all higher for
fluorine than expected from the trends set by other halogens. Also, ionic
and covalent radii, m.p. and b.p., enthalpy of bond dissociation and electron
gain enthalpy are quite lower than expected. The anomalous behaviour of
fluorine is due to its small size, highest electronegativity, low F-F bond
dissociation enthalpy, and non availability of d orbitals in valence shell.
Most of the reactions of fluorine are exothermic (due to the small
and strong bond formed by it with other elements). It forms only one
oxoacid while other halogens form a number of oxoacids. Hydrogen
fluoride is a liquid (b.p. 293 K) due to strong hydrogen bonding.
Hydrogen bond is formed in HF due to small size and high

electronegativity of fluorine. Other hydrogen halides which have bigger
size and less electronegativity are gases.
(i) Reactivity towards hydrogen: They all react with hydrogen to give
hydrogen halides but affinity for hydrogen decreases from fluorine
to iodine. Hydrogen halides dissolve in water to form hydrohalic
acids. Some of the properties of hydrogen halides are given in
Table 7.9. The acidic strength of these acids varies in the order:
HF < HCl < HBr < HI. The stability of these halides decreases down
the group due to decrease in bond (H–X) dissociation enthalpy in
the order: H–F > H–Cl > H–Br > H–I.

(ii) Reactivity towards oxygen: Halogens form many oxides with oxygen
but most of them are unstable. Fluorine forms two oxides OF2 and
O2F2. However, only OF2 is thermally stable at 298 K. These oxides
are essentially oxygen fluorides because of the higher
electronegativity of fluorine than oxygen. Both are strong fluorinating
agents. O2F2 oxidises plutonium to PuF6 and the reaction is used
in removing plutonium as PuF6 from spent nuclear fuel.
Chlorine, bromine and iodine form oxides in which the oxidation
states of these halogens range from +1 to +7. A combination of kinetic
and thermodynamic factors lead to the generally decreasing order of
stability of oxides formed by halogens, I > Cl > Br. Higher stability of
oxides of iodine is due to greater polarisability of bond between
iodine and oxygen. In the case of chlorine, multiple bond formation
between chlorine and oxygen takes place due to availability of
d–orbitals. This leads to increase in stability. Bromine lacks both the
characteristics hence stability of oxides of bromine is least. The higher
oxides of halogens tend to be more stable than the lower ones.
Chlorine oxides, Cl2O, ClO2, Cl2O6 and Cl2O7 are highly reactive
oxidising agents and tend to explode. ClO2 is used as a bleaching
agent for paper pulp and textiles and in water treatment.
The bromine oxides, Br2O, BrO2 , BrO3 are the least stable
halogen oxides (middle row anomally) and exist only at low
temperatures. They are very powerful oxidising agents.
The iodine oxides, I2O4 , I2O5, I2O7 are insoluble solids and
decompose on heating. I2O5 is a very good oxidising agent and is
used in the estimation of carbon monoxide.
(iii) Reactivity towards metals: Halogens react with metals to form
metal halides. For example, bromine reacts with magnesium to give
magnesium bromide.

Mg ( s ) + Br2 ( l ) → MgBr2 ( s )
The ionic character of the halides decreases in the order MF >
MCl > MBr > MI where M is a monovalent metal. If a metal exhibits
more than one oxidation state, the halides in higher oxidation
state will be more covalent than the one in lower oxidation state.
For example, SnCl4, PbCl4, SbCl5 and UF6 are more covalent than
SnCl2, PbCl2, SbCl3 and UF4 respectively.
(iv) Reactivity of halogens towards other halogens: Halogens combine
amongst themselves to form a number of compounds known as

interhalogens of the types XX , XX3 , XX5 and XX7 where X is a

Example 7.16 Fluorine exhibits only –1 oxidation state whereas other halogens
exhibit + 1, + 3, + 5 and + 7 oxidation states also. Explain.

Solution Fluorine is the most electronegative element and cannot exhibit any positive
oxidation state. Other halogens have d orbitals and therefore, can expand
their octets and show + 1, + 3, + 5 and + 7 oxidation states also.

7.19 Chlorine

Chlorine was discovered in 1774 by Scheele by the action of HCl on
MnO2. In 1810 Davy established its elementary nature and suggested the
name chlorine on account of its colour (Greek, chloros = greenish yellow).
Preparation

It can be prepared by any one of the following methods:
(i) By heating manganese dioxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid.
MnO2 + 4HCl → MnCl2 + Cl2 + 2H2O
However, a mixture of common salt and concentrated H2SO4 is
used in place of HCl.
4NaCl + MnO2 + 4H2SO4 → MnCl2 + 4NaHSO4 + 2H2O + Cl2
(ii) By the action of HCl on potassium permanganate.
2KMnO4 + 16HCl → 2KCl + 2MnCl2 + 8H2O + 5Cl2
Manufacture of chlorine

(i) Deacon’s process: By oxidation of hydrogen chloride gas by
atmospheric oxygen in the presence of CuCl2 (catalyst) at 723 K.
CuCl2
4HCl + O2 
→ 2Cl2 + 2H2O
(ii) Electrolytic process: Chlorine is obtained by the electrolysis of
brine (concentrated NaCl solution). Chlorine is liberated at anode.
It is also obtained as a by–product in many chemical industries.
Chemistry 202

2022-23

Properties

It is a greenish yellow gas with pungent and suffocating odour. It is
about 2-5 times heavier than air. It can be liquefied easily into greenish
yellow liquid which boils at 239 K. It is soluble in water.
Chlorine reacts with a number of metals and non-metals to form chlorides.
2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3 ;
P4 + 6Cl2 → 4PCl3
2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl;
S8 + 4Cl2 → 4S2Cl2
2Fe + 3Cl2 → 2FeCl3 ;
It has great affinity for hydrogen. It reacts with compounds
containing hydrogen to form HCl.

H2 + Cl 2 → 2HCl
H2 S + Cl 2 → 2HCl + S
C10 H16 + 8Cl 2 → 16HCl + 10C
With cold and dilute alkalies chlorine produces a mixture of chloride
and hypochlorite but with hot and concentrated alkalies it gives chloride
and chlorate.
2NaOH + Cl2 → NaCl + NaOCl + H2O
(cold and dilute)

6 NaOH + 3Cl2 → 5NaCl + NaClO3 + 3H2O
(hot and conc.)

With dry slaked lime it gives bleaching powder.
2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 → Ca(OCl)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2O
The composition of bleaching powder is Ca(OCl)2.CaCl2.Ca(OH)2.2H2O.
Chlorine reacts with hydrocarbons and gives substitution products
with saturated hydrocarbons and addition products with unsaturated
hydrocarbons. For example,
UV
CH4 + Cl2 
→ CH3Cl + HCl
Methane

Methyl chloride

Room temp.

→ C2H4Cl2

Ethene

1,2-Dichloroethane

Chlorine water on standing loses its yellow colour due to the
formation of HCl and HOCl. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) so formed, gives
nascent oxygen which is responsible for oxidising and bleaching
properties of chlorine.
Chlorine oxidises ferrous to ferric and sulphite to sulphate. Chlorine
oxidises sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide and iodine to iodate. In the
presence of water they form sulphuric acid and iodic acid respectively.
2FeSO4 + H2SO4 + Cl2 → Fe2(SO4)3 + 2HCl
Na2SO3 + Cl2 + H2O → Na2SO4 + 2HCl
SO2 + 2H2O + Cl2 → H2SO4 + 2HCl
I2 + 6H2O + 5Cl2 → 2HIO3 + 10HCl
Chlorine is a powerful bleaching agent; bleaching action is due
to oxidation.
It bleaches vegetable or organic matter in the presence of moisture.
Bleaching effect of chlorine is permanent.
Cl2 + H2O → 2HCl + O
Coloured substance + O → Colourless substance

Uses: It is used (i) for bleaching woodpulp (required for the manufacture of
paper and rayon), bleaching cotton and textiles, (ii) in the extraction of gold
and platinum (iii) in the manufacture of dyes, drugs and organic compounds
such as CCl4, CHCl3, DDT, refrigerants, etc. (iv) in sterilising drinking water

7.20 Hydrogen
Chloride

Glauber prepared this acid in 1648 by heating common salt with
concentrated sulphuric acid. Davy in 1810 showed that it is a compound
of hydrogen and chlorine.
Preparation

In laboratory, it is prepared by heating sodium chloride with
concentrated sulphuric acid.
420 K

HCl gas can be dried by passing through concentrated sulphuric acid.
Properties

It is a colourless and pungent smelling gas. It is easily liquefied to a
colourless liquid (b.p.189 K) and freezes to a white crystalline solid
(f.p. 159 K). It is extremely soluble in water and ionises as follows:

HCl ( g ) + H2O ( l ) → H3O+ ( aq ) + Cl − ( aq )

K a = 107

Its aqueous solution is called hydrochloric acid. High value of
dissociation constant (Ka) indicates that it is a strong acid in water.
It reacts with NH3 and gives white fumes of NH4Cl.
NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl
When three parts of concentrated HCl and one part of concentrated
HNO3 are mixed, aqua regia is formed which is used for dissolving
noble metals, e.g., gold, platinum.

Au + 4H+ + NO3− + 4Cl − → AuCl −4 + NO + 2H2 O
3Pt + 16H + + 4NO3− + 18Cl − → 3PtCl26 − + 4NO + 8H2 O

Na2SO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2O + SO2

Uses
Uses: It is used (i) in the manufacture of chlorine, NH4Cl and glucose (from
corn starch), (ii) for extracting glue from bones and purifying bone black, (iii)
in medicine and as a laboratory reagent.
When HCl reacts with finely powdered iron, it forms ferrous chloride
and not ferric chloride. Why?

Example 7.18

Its reaction with iron produces H2.

Solution

Fe + 2HCl → FeCl 2 + H2
Liberation of hydrogen prevents the formation of ferric chloride.

7.21 Oxoacids of
Halogens

Due to high electronegativity and small size, fluorine forms only one
oxoacid, HOF known as fluoric (I) acid or hypofluorous acid. The other
halogens form several oxoacids. Most of them cannot be isolated in
pure state. They are stable only in aqueous solutions or in the form of
their salts. The oxoacids of halogens are given in Table 7.10 and their
structures are given in Fig. 7.8.

7.22 Interhalogen
Compounds

When two different halogens react with each other, interhalogen
compounds are formed. They can be assigned general compositions as
′
′
′
′
′
XX , XX3 , XX5 and XX7 where X is halogen of larger size and X of
′
smaller size and X is more electropositive than X . As the ratio between
′
radii of X and X increases, the number of atoms per molecule also
increases. Thus, iodine (VII) fluoride should have maximum number of
atoms as the ratio of radii between I and F should be maximum. That
is why its formula is IF7 (having maximum number of atoms).
Preparation

The interhalogen compounds can be prepared by the direct
combination or by the action of halogen on lower interhalogen
compounds. The product formed depends upon some specific
conditions, For example,
437 K
Cl2 + F2 

I2 + 3Cl2 → 2ICl3

These are all covalent molecules and are diamagnetic in nature.
They are volatile solids or liquids at 298 K except ClF which is a
gas. Their physical properties are intermediate between those of
constituent halogens except that their m.p. and b.p. are a little higher
than expected.
Their chemical reactions can be compared with the individual
halogens. In general, interhalogen compounds are more reactive
than halogens (except fluorine). This is because X–X′ bond in
interhalogens is weaker than X–X bond in halogens except F–F
bond. All these undergo hydrolysis giving halide ion derived from
the smaller halogen and a hypohalite ( when XX′), halite ( when
XX′3), halate (when XX′5) and perhalate (when XX′7) anion derived
from the larger halogen.
XX' + H 2 O → HX' + HOX
Their molecular structures are very interesting which can be
explained on the basis of VSEPR theory (Example 7.19). The XX3
compounds have the bent ‘T’ shape, XX5 compounds square pyramidal
and IF7 has pentagonal bipyramidal structures (Table 7.11).

Example 7.19 Discuss the molecular shape of BrF3 on the basis of VSEPR theory.
Solution The central atom Br has seven electrons
in the valence shell. Three of these will form electronpair bonds with three fluorine atoms leaving behind
four electrons. Thus, there are three bond pairs and
two lone pairs. According to VSEPR theory, these
will occupy the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. The
two lone pairs will occupy the equatorial positions
to minimise lone pair-lone pair and the bond pairlone pair repulsions which are greater than the bond
pair-bond pair repulsions. In addition, the axial
fluorine atoms will be bent towards the equatorial
fluorine in order to minimise the lone-pair-lone pair
repulsions. The shape would be that of a slightly
bent ‘T’.

Uses
Uses: These compounds can be used as non aqueous solvents. Interhalogen
compounds are very useful fluorinating agents. ClF3 and BrF3 are used for the

7.23 Group 18
Elements

Group 18 consists of elements: helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon,
radon and oganesson. All these are gases and chemically unreactive.
They form very few compounds, because of this they are termed
as noble gases.

7.23.1 Occurrence

All these gases except radon and oganesson occur in the atmosphere.
Their atmospheric abundance in dry air is ~ 1% by volume of which
argon is the major constituent. Helium and sometimes neon are found
in minerals of radioactive origin e.g., pitchblende, monazite, cleveite.
The main commercial source of helium is natural gas. Xenon and
radon are the rarest elements of the group. Radon is obtained as a

Ra.

Example 7.20 Why are the elements of Group 18 known as noble gases ?
Solution The elements present in Group 18 have their valence shell orbitals
completely filled and, therefore, react with a few elements only under
certain conditions. Therefore, they are now known as noble gases.
Oganesson has its symbol Og, atomic number 118, atomic mass
294 and electronic configuration [Rn] 5f 146d107s27p6. Only very small
amount of Og has been produced. Its half life is 0.7 milliseconds.
Therefore, mainly predictions about its chemistry have been made.
Here, except for oganesson, important atomic and physical
properties of other elements of Group 18 along with their electronic
configurations are given in Table 7.12. The trends in some of the atomic,
physical and chemical properties of the group are discussed here.

7.23.2 Electronic
Configuration

All noble gases have general electronic configuration ns np except
helium which has 1s2 (Table 7.12). Many of the properties of noble
gases including their inactive nature are ascribed to their closed
shell structures.

7.23.3 Ionisation
Enthalpy

Due to stable electronic configuration these gases exhibit very high
ionisation enthalpy. However, it decreases down the group with increase
in atomic size.

7.23.4 Atomic
Radii

Atomic radii increase down the group with increase in atomic
number.

7.23.5 Electron
Gain
Enthalpy

Since noble gases have stable electronic configurations, they have no
tendency to accept the electron and therefore, have large positive values
of electron gain enthalpy.
Physical Properties

All the noble gases are monoatomic. They are colourless, odourless
and tasteless. They are sparingly soluble in water. They have very low
melting and boiling points because the only type of interatomic
interaction in these elements is weak dispersion forces. Helium has the
lowest boiling point (4.2 K) of any known substance. It has an unusual
property of diffusing through most commonly used laboratory materials
such as rubber, glass or plastics.

Example 7.21
Noble gases being monoatomic have no interatomic forces except weak Solution
Noble gases have very low boiling points. Why?

dispersion forces and therefore, they are liquefied at very low
temperatures. Hence, they have low boiling points.
Chemical Properties

In general, noble gases are least reactive. Their inertness to chemical
reactivity is attributed to the following reasons:
2
2
6
(i) The noble gases except helium (1s ) have completely filled ns np
electronic configuration in their valence shell.
(ii) They have high ionisation enthalpy and more positive electron
gain enthalpy.
The reactivity of noble gases has been investigated occasionally,
ever since their discovery, but all attempts to force them to react to
form the compounds, were unsuccessful for quite a few years. In March
1962, Neil Bartlett, then at the University of British Columbia, observed
the reaction of a noble gas. First, he prepared a red compound which
+
–
is formulated as O2 PtF6 . He, then realised that the first ionisation
–1
enthalpy of molecular oxygen (1175 kJmol ) was almost identical with
–1
that of xenon (1170 kJ mol ). He made efforts to prepare same type of
compound with Xe and was successful in preparing another red colour
+
–
compound Xe PtF6 by mixing PtF6 and xenon. After this discovery, a
number of xenon compounds mainly with most electronegative elements
like fluorine and oxygen, have been synthesised.
The compounds of krypton are fewer. Only the difluoride (KrF2) has
been studied in detail. Compounds of radon have not been isolated

compounds of Ar, Ne or He are yet known.

XeF6 can also be prepared by the interaction of XeF4 and O2F2 at 143K.
XeF4 + O2 F2 → XeF6 + O2
XeF2, XeF4 and XeF6 are colourless crystalline solids and sublime
readily at 298 K. They are powerful fluorinating agents. They are readily
hydrolysed even by traces of water. For example, XeF2 is hydrolysed to
give Xe, HF and O2.
2XeF2 (s) + 2H2O(l) → 2Xe (g) + 4 HF(aq) + O2(g)
The structures of the three xenon fluorides can be deduced from
VSEPR and these are shown in Fig. 7.9. XeF2 and XeF 4 have linear and
square planar structures respectively. XeF6 has seven electron pairs (6
bonding pairs and one lone pair) and would, thus, have a distorted
octahedral structure as found experimentally in the gas phase.
Xenon fluorides react with fluoride ion acceptors to form cationic
species and fluoride ion donors to form fluoroanions.

211 The p-Block Elements

2022-23

Summary
Groups 13 to 18 of the periodic table consist of p-block elements with their valence
shell electronic configuration ns2np1–6. Groups 13 and 14 were dealt with in Class
XI. In this Unit remaining groups of the p-block have been discussed.
Group 15 consists of five elements namely, N, P, As, Sb and Bi which have
general electronic configuration ns2np3. Nitrogen differs from other elements of this
group due to small size, formation of pπ–pπ multiple bonds with itself and with
highly electronegative atom like O or C and non-availability of d orbitals to expand
its valence shell. Elements of group 15 show gradation in properties. They react with
oxygen, hydrogen and halogens. They exhibit two important oxidation states, + 3
and + 5 but +3 oxidation is favoured by heavier elements due to ‘inert pair effect’.
Dinitrogen can be prepared in laboratory as well as on industrial scale. It forms
oxides in various oxidation states as N2O, NO, N2O3, NO2, N2O4 and N2O5. These
oxides have resonating structures and have multiple bonds. Ammonia can be
prepared on large scale by Haber’s process. HNO 3 is an important industrial
chemical. It is a strong monobasic acid and is a powerful oxidising agent. Metals
and non-metals react with HNO3 under different conditions to give NO or NO2.
Phosphorus exists as P4 in elemental form. It exists in several allotropic forms.
It forms hydride, PH3 which is a highly poisonous gas. It forms two types of halides as
PX3 and PX5. PCl3 is prepared by the reaction of white phosphorus with dry chlorine
while PCl5 is prepared by the reaction of phosphorus with SO2Cl2. Phosphorus forms
a number of oxoacids. Depending upon the number of P–OH groups, their basicity
varies. The oxoacids which have P–H bonds are good reducing agents.
The Group 16 elements have general electronic configuration ns2np4. They show
maximum oxidation state, +6. Gradation in physical and chemical properties is
observed in the group 16 elements. In laboratory, dioxygen is prepared by heating
KClO3 in presence of MnO2. It forms a number of oxides with metals. Allotropic form
of oxygen is O3 which is a highly oxidising agent. Sulphur forms a number of allotropes.
Of these, α– and β– forms of sulphur are the most important. Sulphur combines with
oxygen to give oxides such as SO2 and SO3. SO2 is prepared by the direct union of
sulphur with oxygen. SO2 is used in the manufacture of H2SO4. Sulphur forms a
number of oxoacids. Amongst them, the most important is H2SO4. It is prepared by
contact process. It is a dehydrating and oxidising agent. It is used in the manufacture
of several compounds.
Group 17 of the periodic table consists of the following elements F, Cl, Br, I and
At.These elements are extremely reactive and as such they are found in the
combined state only. The common oxidation state of these elements is –1. However,
highest oxidation state can be +7. They show regular gradation in physical and
chemical properties. They form oxides, hydrogen halides, interhalogen compounds
and oxoacids. Chlorine is conveniently obtained by the reaction of HCl with KMnO4.
HCl is prepared by heating NaCl with concentrated H2SO4. Halogens combine with
one another to form interhalogen compounds of the type XX1n (n = 1, 3, 5, 7)
where X1 is lighter than X. A number of oxoacids of halogens are known. In the
structures of these oxoacids, halogen is the central atom which is bonded in each
case with one OH bond as X–OH. In some cases X = 0 bonds are also found.
Group 18 of the periodic table consists of noble gases. They have ns2 np6 valence
shell electronic configuration except He which has 1s2. All the gases except Rn
occur in atmosphere. Rn is obtained as the decay product of 226Ra.
Due to complete octet of outermost shell, they have less tendency to form
compounds. The best characterised compounds are those of xenon with fluorine
and oxygen only under certain conditions. These gases have several uses. Argon is
used to provide inert atmosphere, helium is used in filling balloons for meteorological
observations, neon is used in discharge tubes and fluorescent bulbs.

Answers to Some Intext Questions
7.1 Higher the positive oxidation state of central atom, more will be its polarising
power which, in turn, increases the covalent character of bond formed
between the central atom and the other atom.
7.2 Because BiH3 is the least stable among the hydrides of Group 15.
7.3 Because of strong pπ–pπ overlap resulting into the triple bond, N≡N.
7.6 From the structure of N2O5 it is evident that covalence of nitrogen is four.
7.7(a) Both are sp3 hybridised. In PH4+ all the four orbitals are bonded whereas
in PH3 there is a lone pair of electrons on P, which is responsible for lone
pair-bond pair repulsion in PH3 reducing the bond angle to less than
109° 28′.
7.10 PCl5 + H2O → POCl3 + 2HCl
7.11 Three P–OH groups are present in the molecule of H3PO4. Therefore, its
basicity is three.
7.15 Because of small size and high electronegativity of oxygen, molecules of
water are highly associated through hydrogen bonding resulting in its
liquid state.
7.21 Both the S–O bonds are covalent and have equal strength due to resonating
structures.
7.25 H2SO4 is a very strong acid in water largely because of its first ionisation
to H3O+ and HSO4–. The ionisation of HSO4 – to H3O+ and SO42– is very very
small. That is why Ka2 << Ka1.
7.31 In general, interhalogen compounds are more reactive than halogens due
to weaker X–X1 bonding than X–X bond. Thus, ICl is more reactive than I2.
7.34 Radon is radioactive with very short half-life which makes the study of
chemistry of radon difficult.
